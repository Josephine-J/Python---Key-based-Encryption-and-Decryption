# 🔐 Key-Based Encryption and Decryption – Python Project

## 📌 Introduction
This is a Python mini project implementing key-based encryption and decryption to secure messages.  
Developed as part of Besant Technologies training under the guidance of **Ms. Gowthami**.

## ✨ Features
- Encrypts messages using a secret key  
- Decrypts messages using the same key  
- Simple Python implementation for learning purposes  

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Encryption & Decryption  
- Symmetric Key Cryptography  
- String Manipulation in Python  
- User Input Handling  

## 🛠 Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- `tkinter` library *(if used)*  

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python -m tkinter - it is pre-defined library in python so you to check it.
